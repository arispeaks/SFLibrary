# San Francisco (SF) Library User Information

Summary
An analysis of the activities of SF library users as defined by their patron type, home library and other 
information. This project consist of a csv file with the raw data  as provided by the city of SF via Kaggel and a Jupyter notebook that walks through and summarizes the analysis.


## Installation

Python 3.7.6

## Project Motivation

I am an avid reader of sci-fi who found myself perpetually "on hold" when checking out a library book. So I wanted to know:

1. Who really uses the library?
2. Which library branch gets the most activity?
3. What is the renewal rate? and can this be determined if I knew things about the patron?
