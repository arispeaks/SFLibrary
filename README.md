# San Francisco (SF) Library User Information

This is an exploratory analysis of the activities of SF library users as defined by their age range, home library and other 
information. This project consists of a csv file with the raw data as provided by the city of SF their open source website ([DataSF](https://datasf.org/)) and a Jupyter notebook that walks through and summarizes the code that supports any findings.


## Installation

Python 3.7.6

## Project Motivation

I am an avid reader of sci-fi who found myself perpetually "on hold" when checking out a library book. So I wanted to know:

1. Who really uses the library?
2. Which library branch gets the most activity?
3. What is the renewal rate? and can this be determined if I knew things about the patron?


## File Descriptions
